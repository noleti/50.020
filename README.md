50.020
======

Repo for the SUTD 50.020 security class. Current content:

1. The script to fix msfconsole for lab 4
   To run this, do the following on your terminal as "student":

    `cd`

    `git clone https://github.com/noleti/50.020`

    `cp 50.020/* Downloads/`

    `cd Downloads`

    `bash patch1.sh`

   Installation takes about 20 minutes or so. You should be then able to start `msfconsole`.
   Please note that you might have to wait/restart msfconsole for caching to work. This can cause and error where "nmap" command is not found.

Cheers,
Nils
